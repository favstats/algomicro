### Political Microtargeting

+ Discourse on (online) political microtargeting is often focused on the "bad actor" story

  + Russian election interference campaign (IRA)
  
  + Cambridge Analytica
  
--

<br>

+ The explicit assumption here is that the advertisers have strong control over who sees which ad

> But there is more than just targeting criteria that decides who sees political ads:

   + advertisers can set targeting *boundaries*

   + *ad auctions* and *ad delivery algorithms* decide which individual users get ads from which advertiser


---

### Who decides who sees which ad on Meta?


+ **Ad auctions** = an auction takes place that determines which ad by whom is shown: based on *budget*

![](img/auction0.jpg)

---

### Who decides who sees which ad on Meta?


+ **Ad auctions** = an auction takes place that determines which ad by whom is shown: based on *budget*

+ **Relevance** = how relevant is the ad to the user

```{r, out.width="70%", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("img/relevant_quote.png")
```

+ **Ad auctions** = an auction takes place that determines which ad by whom is shown: based on *budget*

![](img/auction1.jpg)

#### The process of finding *relevant* audiences is done by *ad delivery algorithms*: 

#### **algorithmic microtargeting**

---


### Who decides who sees which ad on Meta?


When targeting the same audience, at the same time, with the same budget:

+ Ad delivery is heavily skewed along gendered and racial stereotypes
  + even without the intent of the advertiser [(Ali et al., 2020)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359301)

--

Regarding political ads [(Ali et al., 2021)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3437963.3441801):

--

+ **Skewed delivery**

  + Political ads more often delivered to ideologically congruent audience 
      + Bernie ads → higher % D; 
      + Trump ads → higher % R

--

+ **Increased cost**

  + Liberal ad to a liberal audience: *21 Dollar per 1000 users*; 
  + Conservative ad delivered to liberal audience: *40 Dollar per 1000 users*.

## Research Question

### How does the Meta ad delivery algorithm<br>influence the pricing & distribution of political ads<br>in the Netherlands?

---

class: center, middle

# Research Design

---

### Research Design

+ Algorithm audit study

+ Place the same ads targeting the same audiences (9 different ones)

--

+ Collaborate with Dutch parties to place political ads

+ Final collaboration with 3: 

  1. GroenLinks (Green party)
  2. VVD (centre-right party of PM Rutte)
  3. PvdA (social democrats)
  

--

+ Place ads before nationwide local elections on March 16th 2022
  + 1st to 7th February 2022

+ Spend 2 Euros a day on 45 ad copies

  + in total: 630 Euro per party
  
+ Pre-registered research design and hypotheses [(osf.io/xmc7g)](osf.io/xmc7g)

---

### Hypotheses

![](img/relevant_quote.png)

[(Meta Business Help Center, 2022)](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/430291176997542)


> **H1:** **The more relevant** an audience is for an ad, **the cheaper is the cost** for reaching 1000 users in that audience.

> **H2:** **The more relevant** an audience is for an ad, **the more are ads delivered** to that audience.

--

We expect that ads by party with a greater share of supporters are less expensive (H3a) and reach more people (H3b)

> **H3a:** Parties with a greater share of supporters pay less for reaching 1000 users.

> **H3b:** Parties with a greater share of supporters reach more people than smaller parties.

### Targeting criteria


We used 9 different (paired) targeting criteria for our advertisements

.pull-left[

1. Political interests
2. Excluding political interest

<ol start="3">
  <li>Higher educated audience</li>
  <li>Lower educated audience</li>
</ol>

<ol start="5">
  <li>Environmental interests</li>
  <li>Excluding environmental interests</li>
</ol>

<ol start="7">
  <li>Economic interests</li>
  <li>Excluding Economic interests</li>

### Between-party differences

For everyone:

Ads **cost less for**:

+ *higher-educated* vs. *lower-educated audience*

Ad price **does not statistically differ for**:

+ Audience *interested in the economy* vs. *not interested*

+ Audience *interested in politics* vs. *not interested*

Ads **cost more for**:

+ Audience *interested in the environment* vs. *not interested*

## Summary


---

### Summary

Our findings do not always align with expectations.

--

**However:**

> We find that Meta ad delivery algorithm prioritizes certain parties and audiences for political advertising



There are also *age, gender and regional biases*

Even after controlling for Meta user breakdown:

+ Men systematically receive more ads than women 

+ 18-24 year olds systematically receive less ads 

+ Certain Dutch provinces systematically receive less ads than others 

---



### Implications


+ Meta (dis-)advantages certain parties

  +  political parties were not charged the same price for the same service
  
  + Unequal playing field

--

+ Some groups of people and regions are **systematically** less likely to receive political advertisements and more expensive to reach

  + isolating these groups from receiving election-related information
  
  + may deepen political, social and geographical inequalities

--

+ No transparency by Meta about these systematic biases

  + difficult to research and make visible instances of unequal treatment and price discrimination
  + highlighting importance of access to data
  
--
  
+ Simply "banning" microtargeting would be inadequate

  + more power to the black box algorithm
