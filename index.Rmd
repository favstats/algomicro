### Political Microtargeting

> Personalization of political campaign messages based on (large-scale) data collection

--

<br>

+ Discourse on (online) political microtargeting is often focused on the "bad actor" story

  + Russian election interference campaign (IRA)
  
  + Cambridge Analytica
  
  + Social media company allowing all this to happen

--

<br>

+ The explicit assumption here is that the advertisers have strong control over who sees which ad

--

<br>

There is a distinct lack of research on the *automated* aspect of political microtargeting: 

the **ad delivery algorithm**

---


class: center, middle

# Ad Objectives,<br>Optimizations,<br>Auctions &<br>Relevance

---

### Ad Objectives, Optimizations, Auctions & Relevance

There is more than just targeting criteria that decides who sees political ads:

+ **Ad objective** = what is the goal of the ad?

    for example: generate web traffic, like Facebook page, buy products
    
--

+ **Optimization** = how should the goal be achieved?

    key metric to be optimized on: number of exposed users, clicks, conversions
    
--

+ **Ad auctions** = an auction takes place that determines which ad by whom is shown: based on budget and *relevance*

--

+ **Relevance** = how relevant is the ad to the user

```{r, out.width="70%", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("img/relevant_quote.png")
```

--



→ ***Implies big role of the ad delivery algorithm***

## Prior investigations into the<br>role of the ad delivery algorithm

---

### Pricing differences in the US 2020 election

+ Biden campaign paid more than **6x more** 
  + compared to Trump campaign when targeting older voters. [(The Markup 2020)](https://themarkup.org/election-2020/2020/10/29/facebook-political-ad-targeting-algorithm-prices-trump-biden)
  
  
<center>
```{r, out.width="60%", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("img/older.png")
```
</center>
  
<!-- ![](img/older.png) -->
  
*However, this compares different advertisements*

---

### Prior Research (Ali et al., 2020,2021)


When targeting the same audience, at the same time, with the same budget:

+ Ad delivery is heavily skewed along gendered and racial stereotypes
  + even without the intent of the advertiser [(Ali et al., 2020)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359301)

--

Regarding political ads [(Ali et al., 2021)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3437963.3441801):

--

+ **Skewed delivery**

  + Political ads more often delivered to ideologically congruent audience 
      + Bernie ads → higher % D; 
      + Trump ads → higher % R

--

+ **Increased cost**

  + Liberal ad to a liberal audience: *21 Dollar per 1000 users*; 
  + Conservative ad delivered to liberal audience: *40 Dollar per 1000 users*.

--

*However, this research uses researcher accounts*

## Research Question

### How does the Meta ad delivery algorithm<br>influence the pricing & distribution of political ads<br>in the Netherlands?

---

class: center, middle

# Research Design

---

### Research Design

+ Place the same ads targeting the same audiences (9 different ones)

--

+ Collaborate with Dutch parties to place political ads

+ Final collaboration with 3: 

  1. GroenLinks (Green party)
  2. VVD (centre-right party of PM Rutte)
  3. PvdA (social democrats)
  

--

+ Place ads before nationwide local elections on March 16th 2022
  + 1st to 7th February 2022

+ Spend 2 Euros a day on 45 ad copies

  + in total: 630 Euro per party
  
  
--
  
+ Pre-registered research design and hypotheses [(osf.io/xmc7g)](osf.io/xmc7g)

---



### Dependent Variables

+ Price per 1k users reached

  + this measure is an industry standard

+ Ad delivery share

  + Audience shares measured by % of ads delivered to specific group
  
  + "How many people were reached in Audience A vs. Audience B"
  
  + Pairwise setup which allows us to observe presence and absence of target audience
  
     + e.g. ~60% of audience was interested in politics vs. 40% was not


---


### Research Design


In order to test the algorithm we need to:

+ Place ads with ad goal: *Reach*

+ Ad optimization: *Unique users reached*

<br>

--


Optimizing on Reach (rather than Traffic): 
   
+ the algorithm has to work more on its internal assumptions 

+ doesn't use user cues (i.e. clicks) as much to decide who is going to see the ad

---

### Hypotheses

![](img/relevant_quote.png)

[(Meta Business Help Center, 2022)](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/430291176997542)


> **H1:** **The more relevant** an audience is for an ad, **the cheaper is the cost** for reaching 1000 users in that audience.

> **H2:** **The more relevant** an audience is for an ad, **the more are ads delivered** to that audience.

--

We expect that ads by party with a greater share of supporters are less expensive (H3a) and reach more people (H3b)

> **H3a:** Parties with a greater share of supporters pay less for reaching 1000 users.

> **H3b:** Parties with a greater share of supporters reach more people than smaller parties.


---

### Within- and between-party comparisons

The study design incorporates two *levels of comparisons*

<br>

Observing differences of **pricing and delivery**:


  1. *between parties*
  
    + i.e. we expect pricing and delivery to differ by party

  1. *within a party*
  
    + i.e. we expect pricing and delivery to differ by audience


---

### Ad Relevance


We theorize two different levels of (predicted) relevance:

--

1. Relevant audience for party (i.e. source of ad)

--

+ Ads from an environmentalist party more likely to be relevant for audience interested in environmentalism.

<br>

--

<ol start="2">
  <li>Relevant audience for ad content (i.e. political message)</li>
</ol>


--

+ Political message likely to be relevant for people interested in politics

## Summary

### Summary

Our findings do not always align with expectations:

+ In particular, the measure of ad relevance does not seem to drive pricing as much (although it does affect ad delivery share)

--

**However:**

> We find that Meta ad delivery algorithm prioritizes certain parties and audiences for political advertising


---


### Summary - between-party comparisons


+ Compared to GroenLinks and VVD:

  + PvdA pays less (**32-42 cents less** per 1k overall, ~-9-11%)
  + PvdA reaches more people (~1.1 - 1.3k more per ad, in total: 14-17k more)
  
--

+ People interested in environment
  
  + cheaper for GroenLinks compared to VVD (4 cent, or ~4.1%)
  + no difference in delivery
  
--

+ People interested in economy

  + no difference in pricing (but more expensive when VVD **excludes** audience)
  + VVD higher ad delivery share compared to GroenLinks (1.08% higher)

--

+ Higher-educated people

  + PvdA cheapest and most reach, no advantage for GroenLinks
  
  
---


### Summary - within-party comparisons

+ People interested politics (vs. not)
  + no difference in delivery and pricing
  
--
  
+ Higher-educated people (vs. lower-educated people) 
    
  + cheaper to reach (~-5%)
  + deliver more (~2.6% higher share)
  
--

+ People interested in environment (vs. not)
  
  + more expensive to reach (~+10%)
  + deliver less (~-5.11% lower share)
  
--

+ People interested in economy (vs. not)
  
  + no difference in pricing

### Age, gender and regional biases

Even after controlling for Meta user breakdown:

+ Men systematically receive more ads than women 

+ 18-24 year olds systematically receive less ads 

+ Certain Dutch provinces systematically receive less ads than others 

---



### Implications


+ Meta (dis-)advantages certain parties

  +  the findings presented in this paper show that political parties were not charged the same price for the same service
  
  + Unequal playing field

--

+ Some groups of people and regions are **systematically** less likely to receive political advertisements and more expensive to reach

  + isolating these groups from receiving election-related information
  
  + may deepen political, social and geographical inequalities

--

+ Little to no transparency by Meta about these systematic biases

  + difficult to research and make visible instances of unequal treatment and price discrimination
  + highlighting importance of access to data
  
--
  
+ Simply "banning" microtargeting would be inadequate

  + more power to the black box algorithm

We observe:
